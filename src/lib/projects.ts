        blurb: `Kitchen Goblin is a recipe book platform that allows for iterative recipe storage.

        Each recipe a user stores is capable of storing variations as "Cooks" that may contain differing ingredient lists, directions and miscellaneous notes.
        
        Recipes may also be listed publically or privately. Publically listed recipes will display for all users, logged in or not where as privately listed recipes are only visible to the owning user.`,

        blurb: 'A server/client bundle for a simple text/emoji only chat service built using React, Socket.io and Express. No chat history is saved currently and the application is quite bare bones, being primarily a learning project. MongoDB support to be added later utilizing Mongoose.',

        name: `SpacedOut - Group Project 2`,
        blurb: `'spacedout' aims to be a mental health anti-social social media web app.

        A general idea of the project can be surmised by the user story:
        
        As a user I can:
        
        Make a post about a problem, feeling etc. in confidence
        I can see how many other users have indicated that they also experience the contents of my posts
        View posts from other users and indicate whether I experience the contents of a post
        Hide other user's posts I do not want to see
        Delete or edit my own posts
        The idea behind space your problems is not to replace therapy or other professional assistance services. The space the app is envisioned to occupy is one of a sort of catharsis tool, a user may vent/be vulernable in a safe environment and have the opportunity to feel validated as well.`,
